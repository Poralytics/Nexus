## 🎤 SALES SCRIPTS

### Cold Email Template (B2B)

**Subject:** Noticed [Company] uses [Competitor] - here's why we're better

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] uses [Competitor] for security testing.

We built NEXUS because [Competitor] has 3 big problems:

1. Expensive ($5K/year vs our $588)
2. Manual (vs our 40% auto-remediation)
3. No ROI visibility (vs our €-quantified risks)

Companies like [Similar Company] switched and:
→ Saved $18K in first year
→ Fixed 3x more vulnerabilities
→ Passed SOC 2 audit first try

Want a free security audit of [Company's Domain]?
I'll personally run it and send you the report.

[Your Name]
Founder, NEXUS Security
```

### Demo Call Script

**Minutes 0-5: Discovery**
```
"Tell me about your current security process...
- How many domains/apps do you manage?
- How often do you scan?
- What tool do you use currently?
- What's your biggest pain point?"
```

**Minutes 5-15: Demo**
```
"Let me show you NEXUS with YOUR domain...
[Live scan their site]

See this? [Point to critical vuln]
→ This costs you €500K in expected loss
→ We can auto-fix 40% of these
→ That's $50K saved in the first month

[Show business impact dashboard]

This is what your CISO wants to see - risk in €.
Not just 'high/medium/low'."
```

**Minutes 15-20: Close**
```
"Based on what I'm seeing, NEXUS would:
→ Save you $50K+ per year
→ Free up 20 hours/week of eng time
→ Help you pass your next audit

Want to start a 14-day trial today?
I'll set you up personally."
```
